For NLI: Augmenting data by adding random not_entail examples to the train set from other classes within the train set.
Length of df_train before this step is: 500.

Max augmentation can be: len(df_train) * 2 = 1000. Can also be lower, if there are more entail examples than not-entail for a majority class
For NLI:  not_entail training examples were added, which leads to an augmented training dataset of length 1000.
Number of hypotheses/classes:  4 

For normal test, N classifications necessary: 3832
